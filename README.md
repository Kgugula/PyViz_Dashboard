# Pyviz_Dashboard #

# Hello #

Welcome to my custom dashboard built using holoviews, plotly express, and panels libraries. The dashboard tracks real estate prices in Toronto from 2001 - 2016. As you can see through the graphs, real estate prices in the popular Toronto region have gone only in one direction in the selected time period ...

With that being said, it is still interesting to look at real estate prices on a more granular level. While a rising tide lift all ships, it appears to have been particularly kind to the Top Ten most expensive neighbourhoods.

Scroll through the dashboard, change the interactive features to suit your preferences, and don't be shy in using the 'Wheel Zoom' function (especially for the bar graph on the 'Top Expensive Neighbourhoods' tab)

In the future I would like to keep adding to this dashboard to reflect new prices changes in the same five-year interval format. 

## Further Research ##

As a possible area for further research, it would be interesting to take the data back 10 years or so. This would include the housing market correction in the 90's and thus paint a better picture as to real estate prices in the city, as opposed to the "they will only go up" mentality. Moreover, in future research I would like to see whether COVID-19 had any effect on the location of the neighbourhood bubbles (mass exodus?). 

## Disclaimer ##

None of the prices listed have been adjusted for inflation.
